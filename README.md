With this app you can: Select a category for which type of activity you would like to complete. After that you can enter your specific task including the time you would like to complete that task in, into the inputs below your selected category. Once all those fields are fulfilled you can click 'start activity'. That takes you to the timer section where you begin your countdown to complete the designated task (hopefully) within the alotted time!
After the task is complete you can log the past activity onto a card within the Past Activities section on the right side of the desktop page. If you click 'Create a new activity' it will return you to the starting page where you have the option to favorite and redo past activities as you like! Have fun being more productive!
